My name is Luciano Irigoyen, and I’m currently in my second year at Epitech Digital, where I’m pursuing a Master of Science in Business and Technology Management. I recently completed a two-month internship at GPS CHILE, where I used K-means clustering to segment their customer database, providing valuable business insights.

In addition to that, I developed a prediction program for Formula 1 races, utilizing data such as grid positions, lap times, and weather conditions to predict race outcomes. I built this project using Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines to analyze the data and deliver accurate race predictions.

I have strong skills in SQL and NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, and I’m experienced in using Excel and Jupyter for data analysis. I frequently use Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. Additionally, I’ve built machine learning models using algorithms like Gradient Boosting Machines to tackle complex prediction tasks.

With my background in data science, database management, and machine learning, I focus on creating scalable, efficient solutions that bridge the gap between technology and business needs.

You can just look out for my job, there are many branches with different types of exercises there is a branch dedicated to NoSQL databases with MongoDB requests, another for web scraping, interactions with MongoDB and aggregations/deletes, and complex interactions with databases. In the main branch, you will see some exercises and Jupyter Visualizations, go deep down on the other branches to see my competencies in web scraping and complex database interactions.

There is none of my internship work because all the work that I gave to the enterprise belongs to the enterprise and I do not condone stealing or sharing private information of any type.
