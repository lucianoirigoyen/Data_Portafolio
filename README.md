My name is Luciano Irigoyen, and I’m currently in my second year at Epitech Digital, where I’m pursuing a Master of Science in Business and Technology Management. I recently completed a two-month internship at GPS CHILE, where I used K-means clustering to segment their customer database, providing valuable business insights.

In addition to that, I developed a prediction program for Formula 1 races, utilizing data such as grid positions, lap times, and weather conditions to predict race outcomes. I built this project using Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines to analyze the data and deliver accurate race predictions.

I have strong skills in both SQL and NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, and I’m experienced in using Excel and Jupyter for data analysis. I frequently work with Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. Additionally, I’ve built machine learning models using algorithms like Gradient Boosting Machines to tackle complex prediction tasks.

With my background in data science, database management, and machine learning, I focus on creating scalable, efficient solutions that bridge the gap between technology and business needs.
